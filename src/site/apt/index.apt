Java MyCareNet Project

  The Java MyCareNet Project delivers a Java connector to the MyCareNet platform.

  Besides MyCareNet connectivity, we also provide an eHealth STS, an eHealthBox v3 connector, and an eHealth end-to-end encryption implementation.

  The project delivers a clean room MyCareNet SDK implementation under an unambiguous open source software license that is made available via a public Maven repository.
